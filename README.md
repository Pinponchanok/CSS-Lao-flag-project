# CSS-Lao-flag-project
This week(?) I learned about CSS specificity and inheritance, combining CSS selectors and CSS positioning. After I finished these subjects, the instructor let me do the Lao flag project. It's a little bit confusing and my code is a little bit mass but I am proud that I can do it.
